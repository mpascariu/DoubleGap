Description: Life expectancy is highly correlated over time among countries and 
  between males and females. These associations can be used to improve forecasts. 
  Here we have implemented a method for forecasting female life expectancy based on 
  analysis of the gap between female life expectancy in a country compared with
  the record level of female life expectancy in the world. Second, to forecast 
  male life expectancy, the gap between male life expectancy and female life 
  expectancy in a country is analysed. We named this method the Double-Gap model.
  For a detailed description of the method see Pascariu et al. (2017)
